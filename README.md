we propose a new data augmentation technique called Smart image cropping and patching (SICAP) which Smart crops four images and patches them to create a new training image.

Research is being conducted to create new data out of cropped together images from multiclass problems. Smart Image Cropping and Patching (SICAP), for example, combines pieces of various input images into a single image, and also gives an image a mix of class labels, which results in advantages similar to label smoothing.

Data augmentation is the practice of using data we already have to create new training examples to help our machine learning models generalize better.

Data augmentation using Smart Image Cropping and Patching:

Data augmentation using smart slicing is a data augmentation technique wherein we create a random subset of an original image. This helps our model generalize better because the object(s) of interest we want our models to learn are not always wholly visible in the image or the same scale in our training data.
